//! Tables and data models.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! This module defines the tables in reth, as well as some table-related abstractions:
//!
//! - [`codecs`] integrates different codecs into [`Encode`](crate::abstraction::table::Encode) and
//!   [`Decode`](crate::abstraction::table::Decode)
//! - [`models`] defines the values written to tables
//!
//! # Database Tour
//!
//! TODO(onbjerg): Find appropriate format for this...
